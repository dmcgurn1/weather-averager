# weather-averager
This is a python project that collects weather data from 4 different sources and gives a average weather/more explanatory weather output.
Sources: OpenWeather API, MetOffice Weather API, BBC Weather website, yrno website

You will require your own API key for OpenWeather, as well as your own API 'id' and secret for MetOffice

main.py uses the other .py files to create the variables and give the output

MetOffice weather uses the 'significantweathercodes.json' and 'uv index codes.json'
